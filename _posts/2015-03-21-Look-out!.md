Hey,

At the moment I feel like I should say I plan on posting something like every month from now on.

This is just a small post warning you guys for some very annoying behavior in [DeviceIoControl](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/aa363216%28v=vs.85%29.aspx). After a quick read of the documentation I did code like this:

```
static bool ControlDevice(HIDECOMMAND Command, HIDEINFO* HideInfo)
{
    HANDLE hDevice = GetDeviceHandle();
    if (hDevice == INVALID_HANDLE_VALUE)
	    return false;
    bool result = !!DeviceIoControl(hDevice, //hDevice
                                    Command, //dwIoControlCode
                                    HideInfo, //lpInBuffer
                                    sizeof(HIDEINFO), //nInBufferSize
                                    NULL, //lpOutBuffer
                                    0, //nOutBufferSize
                                    NULL, //lpBytesReturned
                                    NULL //lpOverlapped
                                   ); //
    CloseHandle(hDevice);
    return result;
}
```

Reading the documentation in a quick glance it looked like `lpBytesReturned` and `lpOverlapped` are optional (it says so in the function definition).

I tested the code on Windows 8.1 and everything worked fine, so I published the code. After a while however, my client told me there was a crash on Windows 7 near `DeviceIoControl`.

Reading the documentation again I stumbled across this sentence:

> If lpOverlapped is **NULL**, lpBytesReturned cannot be **NULL**. Even when an operation returns no output data and lpOutBuffer is **NULL**, **DeviceIoControl** makes use of lpBytesReturned. After such an operation, the value of lpBytesReturned is meaningless.

Moral of the story: don't assume *optional* actually means a parameter is optional in WinAPI documentation :)
